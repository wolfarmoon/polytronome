# Polytronome: Geometric Metronome

## Introduction
This is my Code in Place 2025 final project: An idea that have been bouncing around in my head for a while. As a drummer and programmer, obsessed with weird time signatures, polyrhythms and polymetrics, I came to the conclusion that this project was adequate as a final project, as it showcases most of the concepts learnt in the course, plus knowledge of my own. Hope yall like it!



## What it does
Polytronome allow to stack several metronomes in different time signatures—but in time sync—generating polyrhythms. 

## The future
You will be able to select, add or remove metronomes. By now, they are hard coded (sorry, school).
